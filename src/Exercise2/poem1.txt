Future
Trynna find right in my wrongs hope my legacy lives on.
NoCap
It's so much of pain in us, always feel like I'm givin' up 
It ain't the same no more, death brought me anger
Duvy
If they could kill me and you could stop it, would you let 'em?
It's hard to explain my feelings, this life mean more than letters
